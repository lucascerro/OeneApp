Learning-as-we-go App for oene.com.br

I'm learning iOS development as-I-go while making an App for a friend's site (which, at the moment, has only podcasts and newsletters as their products). This is basically a private project, but if someone crazy enough comes by and wants to help, I suppose that would be great (need feedback from my friend on this, before being allowed to accept other people to help).

Cheers!
